How To Play:

Your cannon is on the left side, and your target (red plate) is on the right side.
Other objects are obstacles.
Your goal is to shoot the target. When you hit you gain 1 point, but when you miss
you lose 1 health. The game is over when you remain zero health. Initially you have
3 healths.
