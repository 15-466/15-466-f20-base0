# Shooting Pong

Author: Tianjian Huang

Design: 

In this brand new game, the two paddle become a target and an obstacle. The cannon gives
you more control to the ball, and turns the original boring pong game into a more difficult
shooting game. Try to hit the target!

How To Play:

Your cannon is on the left side, and your target (red plate) is on the right side.
Other objects are obstacles. On the upper left corner of the window is your health
bar (red squares) and score bar.
Rules:
1. Click LMB to fire a bullet.
2. When the bullet hits the target, you gain 1 score.
3. When the bullet hits the upper/lower wall, it bounces.
4. When the bullet hits anything else, you lose 1 health.
5. You win when you get 10 points. You lose when you lose all 3 health.
